While most of these tests are not implementation-specific per se, they are here
because FFS2 is the only file system to support extended attributes in OpenBSD.
In order to perform them, it is necessary:

(1) To have superuser privileges.
(2) To be running a kernel compiled with options 'FFS2' and 'EXTATTR'.
(3) To have a vacant vnd(4) slot represented in 'VND' (an environment variable).

If not set, 'VND' is assumed as 'vnd0'.

A summary of what each test does can be found in the respective '.c' file,
in a comment above the 'main()' function.
