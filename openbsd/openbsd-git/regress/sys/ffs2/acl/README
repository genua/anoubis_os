While most of these tests are not implementation-specific per se, they are here
because FFS2 is the only file system to support access control lists in OpenBSD.
In order to perform them, it is necessary:

(1) To have superuser privileges.
(2) To be running a kernel compiled with options 'FFS2', 'ACL' and 'EXTATTR'.
(3) To have a vacant vnd(4) slot represented in 'VND' (an environment variable).
(4) To have spare '_beta0', '_beta1', '_gamma0' and '_gamma1' groupnames.
(5) To have spare '_alpha0', '_alpha1', '_alpha2' and '_alpha3' usernames.

If not set, 'VND' is assumed as 'vnd0'.

A summary of what each test does can be found in the respective '.sh' file,
in a comment just after the license.
